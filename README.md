# MGvizSignalSync
**Introduccion/objectives:** Multi-omics analysis is a complex process that includes signal detection, interactive exploration, validation, quality control, regions annotation, and finally report generation. These steps are crucial for guiding future research and improving clinical knowledge, which are essential for personalized medicine. These studies aim to identify regions that require signal discrimination, such as Copy Number Variants (CNV), Differentially Methylated Regions (DMR), Variant Allele Frequencies (VAF), read breakpoint patterns for Structural Variations (SV) and viral insertions. However, results obtained using different software tools are often inconsistent. To address this issue, the MGvizSignalSync tool has been developed to establish a consensus of validated signals, helping to improve the reliability and consistency of multi-omics analyses.

**Methods:** The application's frontend, built with React, offers modular development for efficient organization of interface elements. Users can directly load data from their local computers, facilitating dataset integration. A downloadable Docker image facilitates deployment on researchers' servers, enhancing flexibility and scalability. MGvizSignalSync utilizes an LLM layer to deliver an intelligent Decision Support System (DSS) for signal annotation and clinical analysis.

**Results:** We have open-sourced our internal analytic tool that enables annotation of regions, creation of summary concordance results, and consensus region generation for differential signal analysis as CNV or DMR studies.

**Conclusion:** MGvizSignalSync plays a pivotal role in multi-omic research, facilitating signal analysis, decision-making, and result harmonization. Its user-friendly interface and intelligent features could empower researchers to uncover and annotate genomic signals efficiently, ultimately advancing our understanding of complex molecular phenomena.
